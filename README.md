3 variants will be implemented:
* A Hardware with 1 Butterfly unit (Low-cost)

* A Hardware with 4 Butterfly unit (Balanced)

* A Hardware with 16 Butterfly unit (High-performance)

To-do:

1-Use Wallace Tree in Mod3329 module

2-Design decision for 1cc or 2cc ModMul (I think we should go with 2 cc ModMul)

3-Design decision for CSA usage in ModAdd and ModSub

4-<del>Control Signals for BTF/More Simulation for BTF</del>

5-Control Unit for Operation

6-<del>Apply <a href="https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/8544">this technique</a> to butterfly unit</del>
